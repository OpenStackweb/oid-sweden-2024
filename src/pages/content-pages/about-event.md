OpenInfra Day Sweden is organized in collaboration with the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) and part of OpenInfra Days Europe, a series of community-powered OpenInfra Days and meetups throughout May and June 2024.

The event is not for profit, organised by volunteering members of the community and supported by the OpenInfra Foundation.

Together we hope to get the opportunity to meet, learn and discuss a collaborative future towards an openly-developed infrastructure.
