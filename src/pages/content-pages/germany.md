### Event Program

*Coming soon!*

OpenInfra Day Germany is organized in collaboration with the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) and is part of OpenInfra Days Europe, a series of community-run OpenInfra Days and Meetups in May and June 2024.

The event is not-for-profit, organized by community volunteers, supported by the OpenInfra Foundation and paid by our sponsors.
Together we hope to have the opportunity to meet, learn and discuss a common future towards an openly developed infrastructure.

We look forward to a great time together in Berlin!

The OpenInfra Day Germany team
