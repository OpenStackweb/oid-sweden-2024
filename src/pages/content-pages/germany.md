The Sovereign Cloud Stack Summit will be hosted at the same venue the day prior on 14 May. Please note that registration for OpenInfra Day Germany and the Sovereign Cloud Stack Summit are separate. **You must register for each event separately**.

### Event Program

*Coming soon!*

OpenInfra Day Germany is organized in collaboration with the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) and is part of OpenInfra Days Europe, a series of community-run OpenInfra Days and Meetups in May and June 2024.

The event is not-for-profit, organized by community volunteers, supported by the OpenInfra Foundation and paid by our sponsors. Together we hope to have the opportunity to meet, learn and discuss a common future towards an openly developed infrastructure.

We look forward to a great time together in Berlin!

The OpenInfra Day Germany team
