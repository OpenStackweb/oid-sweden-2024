## Welcome to OpenInfra Day Sweden 2024!

On May 7 we will gather at Volvohallen in Gothenburg for yet another Swedish-powered community event about open infrastructure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, and the most relevant technologies in the ecosystem.

The event is **FREE of charge**! Check out the [schedule](https://www.oidsweden2024.se/schedule) and [join us](https://oideurope2024.openinfra.dev/#registration=1)!

### Event Program

Take a look at the schedule [here](https://www.oidsweden2024.se/schedule)!

OpenInfra Day Sweden is organized in collaboration with the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) and part of OpenInfra Days Europe, a series of community-powered OpenInfra Days and meetups throughout May and June 2024.

The event is not for profit, organised by volunteering members of the community and supported by the OpenInfra Foundation.

Together we hope to get the opportunity to meet, learn and discuss a collaborative future towards an openly-developed infrastructure.
